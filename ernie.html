      <p> Ernie has been one of the stars of Sesame Street since its first episode in 1969. <br> </br>
       Ernie and his best friend Bert share the basement apartment at 123 Sesame Street. <br> </br>
      Together they form a comic duo that is one of the program's centerpieces, with Ernie acting the role of the na√Øve trouble-maker and Bert the world-weary foil.<br> </br>
      He is a friend of Bert, who he lives with. His appearance and clothing contrast with Bert, as he is the shorter and more rotund of the pair, wears a shirt with horizontal stripes as opposed to Bert's vertical ones, 
      and has a head that is wider than it is high. In addition, Ernie has no visible eyebrows, while Bert displays a unibrow.

    <p class= "mainParagraph">Intereting facts: Ernie is well known for his fondness for bubble baths with his Rubber Duckie,  <br> </br>and for trying to learn to play the saxophone 
      although he wouldn't "put down the duckie."  <br> </br>
      Ernie is also known for keeping Bert awake at night, for reasons such as wanting to play the drums, 
      wanting to count something (like sheep), to observe something like a blackout,  <br> </br>or even because he is waiting for his upstairs neighbor to drop his shoes.  <br> </br>
      He has a distinctive, snickering laugh (a trait he shares with his baby cousin Ernestine).  <br> </br>
      Ernie has a characteristic chuckling laugh (a trait he shares with his baby cousin, Ernestine), and he also has his signature pronunciation of the word "again" 
      (ay-gain).
