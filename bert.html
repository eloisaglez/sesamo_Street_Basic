    <p> 
      Bert is Ernie's best friend and roommate on Sesame Street. The pair share the basement apartment at 123 Sesame Street. In contrast to the practical-joking, extroverted Ernie, 
      Bert is serious, studious, and tries to make sense of his friend's actions. <br>
      His own passions include reading Boring Stories, 
      collecting paper clips and bottle caps (especially the rare Figgy Fizz), consuming oatmeal, and studying pigeons.

    <p>
      Interesting facts: Unfortunately, Bert's nose has fallen off several times during the course of the series.
      He is left-handed. <br>
      Bert and Ernie were the first muppets to appear in the pilot episode of Sesame Street.
      He made one appearance on The Muppet Show: in episode #102 (where he sang Some Enchanted Evening) and in episode #518. <br>
      Bert was involved as a director in Elmopalooza.
